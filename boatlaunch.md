# Boatlaunch Case Study


>"TBC"

> Geoffrey Campbell

### Summary

Boatlaunch UK is a community-driven website which records details of boat slipways across the UK and some in Europe. It welcomes users to record slipways they have used or come across, and update information concerning slipways.

Boatlaunch already possessed a rather dated native application. Our brief for the MVP sprint was to build a prototype web application with a view to extending this to a native application later in the year, after user testing had been conducted.

### Challenge

The main challenge was dealing with a relatively large amount of data (or at least much larger than we'd dealt with before!) and presenting this in an intuitive, user-friendly way.

A further challenge was to convert our web application to a sample of a native application using phonegap.

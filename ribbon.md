## Ribbon case study

#### Summary

Tom and Matt came to us requiring an MVP in the form of a website. The service was to be aimed initially at men, who wish to buy unusual, unique and limited edition gifts for their partners.
The website had to be designed with a mobile first approach with an emphasis on simplicity and a frictionless process for users.

#### Challenge

This was a 1 week sprint so we had to manage our time well. We had to come up with a way to let our non-technical clients edit the images and descriptions of the products on offer without editing the code. The website also had to be able to take real payments, this create a lot of security issues which have to be taken very seriously.

#### The Solution

We used Stripe to take payments as it is dependable and can be used by people who are not signed up. We used a database with a simple online dashboard to allow the clients to update the information about the products on sale. To speed up the styling of the app we used Bootstrap, this also gives a consistent look to the web site.
